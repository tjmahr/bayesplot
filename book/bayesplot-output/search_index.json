Currently bayesplot offers a variety of plots of posterior draws, visual MCMC diagnostics, as well as graphical posterior predictive checking. Additional functionality (e.g. for forecasting/out-of-sample prediction and other inference-related tasks) will be added in future releases. The plots created by bayesplot are ggplot objects, which means that after a plot is created it can be further customized using the various functions for modifying ggplot objects provided by the ggplot2 package. The idea behind bayesplot is not only to provide convenient functionality for users, but also a common set of functions that can be easily used by developers working on a variety of packages for Bayesian modeling, particularly (but not necessarily) those powered by RStan.

The idea behind posterior predictive checking is simple: if a model is a good fit then we should be able to use it to generate data that looks a lot like the data we observed. 2.1 Posterior predictive distribution To generate the data used for posterior predictive checks (PPCs) we simulate from the posterior predictive distribution The posterior predictive distribution is the distribution of the outcome variable implied by a model after using the observed data \\(y\\) (a vector of \\(N\\) outcome values) to update our beliefs about unknown model parameters \\(\\theta\\). The posterior predictive distribution for observation \\(\\widetilde{y}\\) can be written as \\[p(\\widetilde{y} \\,|\\, y) = \\int p(\\widetilde{y} \\,|\\, \\theta) \\, p(\\theta \\,|\\, y) \\, d\\theta.\\] Typically we will also condition on \\(X\\) (a matrix of predictor variables). For each draw (simulation) \\(s = 1, \\ldots, S\\) of the parameters from the posterior distribution, \\(\\theta^{(s)} \\sim p(\\theta \\,|\\, y)\\), we draw an entire vector of \\(N\\) outcomes \\(\\widetilde{y}^{(s)}\\) from the posterior predictive distribution by simulating from the data model conditional on parameters \\(\\theta^{(s)}\\). The result is an \\(S \\times N\\) matrix of draws \\(\\widetilde{y}\\). When simulating from the posterior predictive distribution we can use either the same values of the predictors \\(X\\) that we used when fitting the model or new observations of those predictors. When we use the same values of \\(X\\) we denote the resulting simulations by \\(y^{rep}\\), as they can be thought of as replications of the outcome \\(y\\) rather than predictions for future observations (\\(\\widetilde{y}\\) using predictors \\(\\widetilde{X}\\)). This corresponds to the notation from Gelman et. al. (2013) and is the notation used throughout the package documentation. 2.2 Graphical posterior predictive checks Using the replicated datasets drawn from the posterior predictive distribution, the functions in the bayesplot package create various graphical displays comparing the observed data \\(y\\) to the replications. The names of the bayesplot plotting functions for posterior predictive checking all have the prefix ppc_. 2.3 Fitting some example models To demonstrate some of the various PPCs that can be created with the bayesplot package we’ll use an example of comparing Poisson and Negative binomial regression models from the rstanarm package vignette stan_glm: GLMs for Count Data (Gabry and Goodrich, 2017). We want to make inferences about the efficacy of a certain pest management system at reducing the number of roaches in urban apartments. […] The regression predictors for the model are the pre-treatment number of roaches roach1, the treatment indicator treatment, and a variable senior indicating whether the apartment is in a building restricted to elderly residents. Because the number of days for which the roach traps were used is not the same for all apartments in the sample, we include it as an exposure […]. First we fit a Poisson regression model with outcome variable y representing the roach count in each apartment at the end of the experiment. library(&quot;rstanarm&quot;) head(roaches) # see help(&quot;rstanarm-datasets&quot;) roaches$roach1 &lt;- roaches$roach1 / 100 # pre-treatment number of roaches (in 100s) fit_poisson &lt;- stan_glm(y ~ roach1 + treatment + senior, offset = log(exposure2), family = poisson(link = &quot;log&quot;), data = roaches, seed = 1111) print(fit_poisson) stan_glm family: poisson [log] formula: y ~ roach1 + treatment + senior ------ Estimates: Median MAD_SD (Intercept) 3.100000e+00 0.000000e+00 roach1 6.982892e+17 8.985513e+15 treatment -5.000000e-01 0.000000e+00 senior -4.000000e-01 0.000000e+00 Sample avg. posterior predictive distribution of y (X = xbar): Median MAD_SD mean_PPD 25.7 0.4 ------ For info on the priors used see help(&#39;prior_summary.stanreg&#39;). We’ll also fit the negative binomial model that we’ll compare to the poisson: fit_nb &lt;- update(fit_poisson, family = &quot;neg_binomial_2&quot;) print(fit_nb) stan_glm family: neg_binomial_2 [log] formula: y ~ roach1 + treatment + senior ------ Estimates: Median MAD_SD (Intercept) 2.800000e+00 2.000000e-01 roach1 1.310997e+18 2.416002e+17 treatment -8.000000e-01 2.000000e-01 senior -3.000000e-01 2.000000e-01 reciprocal_dispersion 3.000000e-01 0.000000e+00 Sample avg. posterior predictive distribution of y (X = xbar): Median MAD_SD mean_PPD 50.2 29.1 ------ For info on the priors used see help(&#39;prior_summary.stanreg&#39;). In order to use the PPC functions from the bayesplot package we need a matrix of draws from the posterior predictive distribution. Since we fit the models using rstanarm we can use its posterior_predict function: yrep_poisson &lt;- posterior_predict(fit_poisson, draws = 500) yrep_nb &lt;- posterior_predict(fit_nb, draws = 500) dim(yrep_poisson) [1] 500 262 dim(yrep_nb) [1] 500 262 For each of the yrep matrices, every row is a draw from the posterior predictive distribution, i.e. a vector with one element for each of the data points in y. 2.4 Histograms and density estimates The first PPC we’ll look at is a comparison of the distribution of y and the distributions of some of the simulated datasets (rows) in the yrep matrix. library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) library(&quot;bayesplot&quot;) color_scheme_set(&quot;brightblue&quot;) # see help(&quot;bayesplot-colors&quot;) y &lt;- roaches$y ppc_dens_overlay(y, yrep_poisson[1:50, ]) In the plot above, the dark line is the distribution of the observed outcomes y and each of the 50 lighter lines is the kernel density estimate of one of the replications of y from the posterior predictive distribution (i.e., one of the rows in yrep). This plot makes it easy to see that this model fails to account for large proportion of zeros in y. That is, the model predicts fewer zeros than were actually observed. We could see the same thing by looking at separate histograms of y and some of the yrep datasets using the ppc_hist function: ppc_hist(y, yrep_poisson[1:5, ]) The same plot for the negative binomial model looks much different: ppc_hist(y, yrep_nb[1:5, ]) The negative binomial model does better handling the number of zeros in the data, but it occasionally predicts values that are way too large, which is why the x-axes extend to such high values in the plot and make it difficult to read. To see the predictions for the smaller values more clearly we can zoom in: ppc_hist(y, yrep_nb[1:5, ], binwidth = 20) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-1, 500)) 2.5 Distributions of test statistics Another way to see that the Poisson model predicts too few zeros is to use the ppc_stat function to look at the distribution of the proportion of zeros over the replicated datasets from the posterior predictive distribution in yrep and compare to the proportion of observed zeros in y. First we define a function that takes a vector as input and returns the proportion of zeros: prop_zero &lt;- function(x) mean(x == 0) prop_zero(y) # check proportion of zeros in y [1] 0.3587786 Then we can use this function as the stat argument to ppc_stat: ppc_stat(y, yrep_poisson, stat = &quot;prop_zero&quot;) Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot;

For links to the documentation for all of the various PPC plots see help(&quot;PPC-overview&quot;). The available_ppc function can also be used to list the names of all PPC plotting functions: available_ppc() bayesplot PPC module: ppc_bars ppc_bars_grouped ppc_boxplot ppc_dens ppc_dens_overlay ppc_ecdf_overlay ppc_error_binned ppc_error_hist ppc_error_hist_grouped ppc_error_scatter ppc_error_scatter_avg ppc_error_scatter_avg_vs_x ppc_freqpoly ppc_freqpoly_grouped ppc_hist ppc_intervals ppc_intervals_grouped ppc_loo_intervals ppc_loo_pit ppc_loo_ribbon ppc_ribbon ppc_ribbon_grouped ppc_rootogram ppc_scatter ppc_scatter_avg ppc_scatter_avg_grouped ppc_stat ppc_stat_2d ppc_stat_freqpoly_grouped ppc_stat_grouped ppc_violin_grouped Many of the available PPCs can also be carried out within levels of a grouping variable. Any function for PPCs by group will have a name ending in _grouped and will accept an additional argument group. For example, ppc_stat_grouped is the same as ppc_stat except that the test statistics are computed within levels of the grouping variable and a separate plot is made for each level: ppc_stat_grouped(y, yrep_nb, group = roaches$treatment, stat = &quot;prop_zero&quot;) Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot;

Authors of R packages for Bayesian inference are encouraged to define methods for the fitted model objects created by their packages. This will hopefully be convenient for both users and developers and contribute to the use of the same naming conventions across many of the R packages for Bayesian data analysis. To provide an interface to bayesplot from your package, you can very easily define a pp_check method (or multiple pp_check methods) for the fitted model objects created by your package. All a pp_check method needs to do is provide the y vector and yrep matrix arguments to the various plotting functions included in bayesplot. 2.7.1 Defining a pp_check method Here is an example for how to define a simple pp_check method in a package that creates fitted model objects of class &quot;foo&quot;. We will define a method pp_check.foo that extracts the data y and the draws from the posterior predictive distribution yrep from an object of class &quot;foo&quot; and then calls one of the plotting functions from bayesplot. Suppose that objects of class &quot;foo&quot; are lists with named components, two of which are y and yrep. Here’s a simple method pp_check.foo that offers the user the option of two different plots: pp_check.foo &lt;- function(object, ..., type = c(&quot;multiple&quot;, &quot;overlaid&quot;)) { y &lt;- object[[&quot;y&quot;]] yrep &lt;- object[[&quot;yrep&quot;]] switch( match.arg(type), multiple = ppc_hist(y, yrep[1:min(8, nrow(yrep)),, drop = FALSE]), overlaid = ppc_dens_overlay(y, yrep) ) } To try out pp_check.foo we can just make a list with y and yrep components and give it class foo: x &lt;- list(y = rnorm(50), yrep = matrix(rnorm(5000), nrow = 100, ncol = 50)) class(x) &lt;- &quot;foo&quot; pp_check(x) pp_check(x, type = &quot;overlaid&quot;) 2.7.2 Examples of pp_check methods in other packages Several packages currently (or will soon) use this approach to provide an interface to bayesplot’s graphical posterior predictive checks. See, for example, the pp_check methods in the rstanarm and brms packages. "],

MCMC diagnostic plots are covered in the separate vignette Visual MCMC diagnostics using the bayesplot package, and graphical posterior predictive checks are covered in Graphical posterior predictive checks using the bayesplot package. 3.1 Fitting an example model The bayesplot package provides various plotting functions for visualizing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) draws from the posterior distribution of the parameters of a Bayesian model. In this vignette we’ll use draws obtained using the stan_glm function in the rstanarm package (Gabry and Goodrich, 2017), but MCMC draws from using any package can be used with the functions in the bayesplot package. See, for example, brms (which, like rstanarm, calls the rstan package internally to use Stan’s MCMC sampler). library(&quot;rstanarm&quot;) fit &lt;- stan_glm( mpg ~ ., # ~ . includes all other variables in dataset data = mtcars, chains = 4, iter = 2000, seed = 1111 ) print(fit) stan_glm family: gaussian [identity] formula: mpg ~ . ------ Estimates: Median MAD_SD (Intercept) 12.9 19.9 cyl -0.1 1.1 disp 0.0 0.0 hp 0.0 0.0 drat 0.8 1.6 wt -3.7 1.9 qsec 0.8 0.8 vs 0.3 2.1 am 2.5 2.1 gear 0.7 1.6 carb -0.2 0.8 sigma 2.7 0.4 Sample avg. posterior predictive distribution of y (X = xbar): Median MAD_SD mean_PPD 20.1 0.7 ------ For info on the priors used see help(&#39;prior_summary.stanreg&#39;). To use the posterior draws with the functions in the bayesplot package we’ll extract them from the fitted model object: posterior &lt;- as.array(fit) dim(posterior) [1] 1000 4 12 dimnames(posterior) $iterations NULL $chains [1] &quot;chain:1&quot; &quot;chain:2&quot; &quot;chain:3&quot; &quot;chain:4&quot; $parameters [1] &quot;(Intercept)&quot; &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; &quot;hp&quot; &quot;drat&quot; [6] &quot;wt&quot; &quot;qsec&quot; &quot;vs&quot; &quot;am&quot; &quot;gear&quot; [11] &quot;carb&quot; &quot;sigma&quot; 3.2 Interval estimates Posterior intervals for the parameters can be plotted using the mcmc_intervals function. library(&quot;bayesplot&quot;) color_scheme_set(&quot;red&quot;) mcmc_intervals(posterior, pars = c(&quot;cyl&quot;, &quot;drat&quot;, &quot;am&quot;, &quot;sigma&quot;)) The default is to show 50% intervals (the thick lines) and 90% intervals (the thinner outer lines). These defaults can be changed using the prob and prob_outer arguments, respectively. The points in the above plot are posterior medians. The point_est argument can be used to select posterior means instead or to omit the point estimates. To show the uncertainty intervals as shaded areas under the estimated posterior density curves we can use the mcmc_areas function: mcmc_areas( posterior, pars = c(&quot;cyl&quot;, &quot;drat&quot;, &quot;am&quot;, &quot;sigma&quot;), prob = 0.8, # 80% intervals prob_outer = 0.99, # 99% point_est = &quot;mean&quot; ) 3.3 Histograms and density estimates Histograms or kernel density estimates of posterior distributions of the various model parameters can be visualized using the functions described on the MCMC-distributions page in the bayesplot documentation. The mcmc_hist and mcmc_dens functions plot posterior distributions (combining all chains): color_scheme_set(&quot;green&quot;) mcmc_hist(posterior, pars = c(&quot;wt&quot;, &quot;am&quot;)) mcmc_dens(posterior, pars = c(&quot;wt&quot;, &quot;am&quot;)) To view the four Markov chain separately we can use mcmc_hist_by_chain, mcmc_dens_overlay: color_scheme_set(&quot;brightblue&quot;) mcmc_hist_by_chain(posterior, pars = c(&quot;wt&quot;, &quot;am&quot;)) mcmc_dens_overlay(posterior, pars = c(&quot;wt&quot;, &quot;am&quot;)) The mcmc_violin function also plots the density estimates of each chain as violins with horizontal lines at user-specified quantiles: mcmc_violin(posterior, pars = c(&quot;wt&quot;, &quot;am&quot;), probs = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9)) 3.4 Scatterplots The mcmc_scatter function creates a scatterplot with two parameters: color_scheme_set(&quot;gray&quot;) mcmc_scatter(posterior, pars = c(&quot;(Intercept)&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;), size = 1.5, alpha = 0.5) The mcmc_hex function creates a similar plot but using hexagonal binning, which can be useful to avoid overplotting: mcmc_hex(posterior, pars = c(&quot;(Intercept)&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;)) In addition to mcmc_scatter and mcmc_hex, as of bayesplot version 1.2.0 an mcmc_pairs function for creating pairs plots with more than two parameters is available. Examples will eventually be included in this vignette. For now see help(&quot;mcmc_pairs&quot;). 3.5 Traceplots The mcmc_trace function creates standard traceplots: color_scheme_set(&quot;blue&quot;) mcmc_trace(posterior, pars = c(&quot;wt&quot;, &quot;sigma&quot;)) If it’s hard to see the difference between the chains we can change to a mixed color scheme, for example: color_scheme_set(&quot;mix-blue-red&quot;) mcmc_trace(posterior, pars = c(&quot;wt&quot;, &quot;sigma&quot;), facet_args = list(ncol = 1, strip.position = &quot;left&quot;)) The code above also illustrates the use of the facet_args argument, which is a list of parameters passed to facet_wrap in ggplot2. Specifying ncol=1 means the traceplots will be stacked in a single column rather than placed side by side, and strip.position=&quot;left&quot; moves the facet labels to the y-axis (instead of above each facet). The &quot;viridis&quot; color scheme is also useful for traceplots because it is comprised of very distinct colors: color_scheme_set(&quot;viridis&quot;) mcmc_trace(posterior, pars = &quot;(Intercept)&quot;) The mcmc_trace_highlight function uses points instead of lines and reduces the opacity of all but a single chain (which is specified using the highlight argument). mcmc_trace_highlight(posterior, pars = &quot;sigma&quot;, highlight = 3) "],
["mcmc-diagnostics.html", "4 MCMC Diagnostics 4.1 General MCMC diagnostics 4.2 Diagnostics for the No-U-Turn Sampler", " 4 MCMC Diagnostics This vignette focuses on MCMC diagnostic plots. Plots of parameter estimates from MCMC draws are covered in the separate vignette Plotting MCMC draws using the bayesplot package, and graphical posterior predictive checks are covered in Graphical posterior predictive checks using the bayesplot package. In addition to bayesplot we’ll load the following packages: ggplot2 for customizing the ggplot objects created by bayesplot rstan for fitting the example models used throughout the vignette library(&quot;bayesplot&quot;) library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) library(&quot;rstan&quot;) 4.1 General MCMC diagnostics A Markov chain generates draws from the target distribution only after it has converged to equilibrium. Unfortunately, this is only guaranteed in the limit in theory. In practice, diagnostics must be applied to monitor whether the Markov chain(s) have converged. The bayesplot package provides various plotting functions for visualizing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics after fitting a Bayesian model. MCMC draws from any package can be used with bayesplot, although there are a few diagnostic plots that are specifically intended to be used for Stan models. To demonstrate, in this vignette we’ll use the eight schools example discussed in Rubin (1981), Gelman et al (2013), and the RStan Getting Started wiki. This is a simple hierarchical meta-analysis model with data consisting of point estimates y and standard errors sigma from analyses of test prep programs in J=8 schools: schools_dat &lt;- list( J = 8, y = c(28, 8, -3, 7, -1, 1, 18, 12), sigma = c(15, 10, 16, 11, 9, 11, 10, 18) ) The model is: \\[\\begin{align*} y_j &amp;\\sim {\\rm Normal}(\\theta_j, \\sigma_j), \\quad j = 1,\\dots,J \\\\ \\theta_j &amp;\\sim {\\rm Normal}(\\mu, \\tau), \\quad j = 1, \\dots, J \\\\ \\mu &amp;\\sim {\\rm Normal}(0, 10) \\\\ \\tau &amp;\\sim {\\rm half-Cauchy}(0, 10), \\end{align*}\\] with the normal distribution parameterized by the mean and standard deviation, not the variance or precision. In Stan code: // Saved in &#39;schools_mod1.stan&#39; data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; J; vector[J] y; vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[J] sigma; } parameters { real mu; real&lt;lower=0&gt; tau; vector[J] theta; } model { mu ~ normal(0, 10); tau ~ cauchy(0, 10); theta ~ normal(mu, tau); y ~ normal(theta, sigma); } This parameterization of the model is referred to as the centered parameterization (CP). We’ll also fit the same statistical model but using the so-called non-centered parameterization (NCP), which replaces the vector \\(\\theta\\) with a vector \\(\\eta\\) of a priori i.i.d. standard normal parameters and then contructs \\(\\theta\\) deterministically from \\(\\eta\\) by scaling by \\(\\tau\\) and shifting by \\(\\mu\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta_j &amp;= \\mu + \\tau \\,\\eta_j, \\quad j = 1,\\dots,J \\\\ \\eta_j &amp;\\sim N(0,1), \\quad j = 1,\\dots,J. \\end{align*}\\] The Stan code for this model is: // Saved in &#39;schools_mod2.stan&#39; data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; J; vector[J] y; vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[J] sigma; } parameters { real mu; real&lt;lower=0&gt; tau; vector[J] eta; } transformed parameters { vector[J] theta; theta = mu + tau * eta; } model { mu ~ normal(0, 10); tau ~ cauchy(0, 10); eta ~ normal(0, 1); // implies theta ~ normal(mu, tau) y ~ normal(theta, sigma); } The centered and non-centered are two parameterizations of the same statistical model, but they have very different practical implications for MCMC. Using the bayesplot diagnostic plots, we’ll see that, for this data, the NCP is required in order to properly explore the posterior distribution. To fit both models we first translate the Stan code to C++ and compile it using the stan_model function. schools_mod1 &lt;- stan_model(&quot;schools_mod1.stan&quot;) schools_mod2 &lt;- stan_model(&quot;schools_mod2.stan&quot;) We then fit the model by calling Stan’s MCMC algorithm using the sampling function, fit1 &lt;- sampling(schools_mod1, data = schools_dat) Warning: There were 112 divergent transitions after warmup. Increasing adapt_delta above 0.8 may help.

We will come back to those later in the vignette in the Diagnostics for the No-U-Turn Sampler section. 4.1.1 Rhat: potential scale reduction statistic One way to monitor whether a chain has converged to the equilibrium distribution is to compare its behavior to other randomly initialized chains. This is the motivation for the Gelman and Rubin (1992) potential scale reduction statistic, \\(\\hat{R}\\). The \\(\\hat{R}\\) statistic measures the ratio of the average variance of samples within each chain to the variance of the pooled samples across chains; if all chains are at equilibrium, these will be the same and \\(\\hat{R}\\) will be one. If the chains have not converged to a common distribution, the \\(\\hat{R}\\) statistic will be greater than one. (Stan Development Team, 2016). The bayesplot package provides the functions mcmc_rhat and mcmc_rhat_hist for visualizing \\(\\hat{R}\\) estimates. First we’ll quickly fit one of the models above again, this time intentionally using too few MCMC iterations. This should lead to some high \\(\\hat{R}\\) values. fit1_50iter &lt;- sampling(schools_mod1, data = schools_dat, chains = 2, iter = 50) Warning: There were 1 chains where the estimated Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information was low.

See the Examples section in help(&quot;mcmc_rhat_hist&quot;) for examples. 4.1.2 Effective sample size The effective sample size is an estimate of the number of independent draws from the posterior distribution of the estimand of interest. Because the draws within a Markov chain are not independent if there is autocorrelation, the effective sample size, \\(n_{eff}\\), will be smaller than the total sample size, \\(N\\). The larger the ratio of \\(n_{eff}\\) to \\(N\\) the better. The bayesplot package provides a generic neff_ratio extractor function, currently with methods defined for models fit using the rstan and rstanarm packages. But regardless of how you fit your model, all bayesplot needs is a vector of \\(n_{eff}/N\\) values. The mcmc_neff and mcmc_neff_hist can then be used to plot the ratios. ratios1 &lt;- neff_ratio(fit1) print(ratios1) mu tau theta[1] theta[2] theta[3] theta[4] 0.16952153 0.06236405 0.31542221 0.39050864 0.25860497 0.38907656 theta[5] theta[6] theta[7] theta[8] lp__ 0.23453017 0.22865204 0.27410482 0.42519409 0.03754553 mcmc_neff(ratios1) Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x $y, : font &quot;Symbol&quot; could not be found for family &quot;serif&quot; In the plot, the points representing the values of \\(n_{eff}/N\\) are colored based on whether they are less than \\(0.1\\), between \\(0.1\\) and \\(0.5\\), or greater than \\(0.5\\). These particular values are arbitrary in that they have no particular theoretical meaning, but a useful heuristic is to worry about any \\(n_{eff}/N\\) less than \\(0.1\\). One important thing to keep in mind is that these ratios will depend not only on the model being fit but also on the particular MCMC algorithm used. One reason why we have such high ratios of \\(n_{eff}\\) to \\(N\\) is that the No-U-Turn sampler used by rstan generally produces draws from the posterior distribution with much lower autocorrelations compared to draws obtained using other MCMC algorithms (e.g., Gibbs). Even for models fit using rstan the parameterization can make a big difference. Here are the \\(n_{eff}/N\\) plots for fit1 and fit2 side by side. # A function we&#39;ll use several times to plot comparisons of the centered # parameterization (cp) and the non-centered parameterization (ncp).

We can visualize the autocorrelation using the mcmc_acf (line plot) or mcmc_acf_bar (bar plot) functions. For the selected parameters, these functions show the autocorrelation for each Markov chain separately up to a user-specified number of lags. Here we can again see a difference when comparing the two parameterizations of the same model. For model 1, \\(\\theta_1\\) is the primitive parameter for school 1, whereas for the non-centered parameterization in model 2 the primitive parameter is \\(\\eta_1\\) (and \\(\\theta_1\\) is later constructed from \\(\\eta_1\\), \\(\\mu\\), and \\(\\tau\\)): compare_cp_ncp( mcmc_acf(posterior1, pars = &quot;theta[1]&quot;, lags = 10), mcmc_acf(posterior2, pars = &quot;eta[1]&quot;, lags = 10), ncol = 2 ) 4.2 Diagnostics for the No-U-Turn Sampler The No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS, Hoffman and Gelman, 2014) is the variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) used by Stan and the various R packages that depend on Stan for fitting Bayesian models. The bayesplot package has special functions for visualizing some of the unique diagnostics permitted by HMC, and NUTS in particular. See Betancourt (2017), Betancourt and Girolami (2013), and Stan Development Team (2016) for more details on the concepts. The special bayesplot functions for NUTS diagnostics are available_mcmc(pattern = &quot;_nuts_&quot;) bayesplot MCMC module: (matching pattern &#39;_nuts_&#39;) mcmc_nuts_acceptance mcmc_nuts_divergence mcmc_nuts_energy mcmc_nuts_stepsize mcmc_nuts_treedepth The bayesplot package also provides generic functions log_posterior and nuts_params for extracting the required information for the plots from fitted model objects. Currently methods are provided for models fit using the rstan and rstanarm packages, although it is not difficult to define additional methods for the objects returned by other R packages. For the Stan models we fit above we can use the log_posterior and nuts_params methods for stanfit objects: lp1 &lt;- log_posterior(fit1) head(lp1) Iteration Value Chain 1 1 -17.65483 1 2 2 -15.90200 1 3 3 -15.72833 1 4 4 -15.65560 1 5 5 -18.86305 1 6 6 -15.83912 1 np1 &lt;- nuts_params(fit1) head(np1) Iteration Parameter Value Chain 1 1 accept_stat__ 0.9292370 1 2 2 accept_stat__ 0.7385983 1 3 3 accept_stat__ 0.7500205 1 4 4 accept_stat__ 0.8597178 1 5 5 accept_stat__ 0.9372548 1 6 6 accept_stat__ 0.9919999 1 # for the second model lp2 &lt;- log_posterior(fit2) np2 &lt;- nuts_params(fit2) 4.2.1 Divergent transitions When running the Stan models at the beginning of this vignette there were warnings about divergent transitions. For an explanation of these warnings see Divergent transitions after warmup. The divergences argument to the mcmc_trace function can be used to add a rug plot (in red) of the divergences to a trace plot of parameter draws. Typically we can see that at least one of the chains is getting stuck wherever there is a cluster of many red marks: color_scheme_set(&quot;mix-brightblue-gray&quot;) mcmc_trace(posterior1, pars = &quot;tau&quot;, divergences = np1) + xlab(&quot;Post-warmup Iteration&quot;) To look deeper at the information conveyed by the divergences we can use the mcmc_nuts_divergence function: color_scheme_set(&quot;red&quot;) mcmc_nuts_divergence(np1, lp1) In the top panel we see the distribution of the log-posterior when there was no divergence vs the distribution when there was a divergence. Divergences often indicate that some part of the posterior isn’t being explored and lp|Divergence will have lighter tails than lp|No divergence. The bottom panel shows the same thing but instead of the log-posterior the NUTS acceptance statistic is shown. Specifying the optional chain argument will overlay the plot just for a particular Markov chain on the plot for all chains combined: mcmc_nuts_divergence(np1, lp1, chain = 4) For the non-centered parameterization we also had warnings about divergences mcmc_nuts_divergence(np2, lp2) but we have far fewer of them to worry about. If there are only a few divergences we can often get rid of them by increasing the target acceptance rate (adapt_delta), which has the effect of lowering the stepsize used by the sampler and allowing the Markov chains to explore more complicated curvature in the target distribution. fit1b &lt;- sampling(schools_mod1, data = schools_dat, control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)) Warning: There were 41 divergent transitions after warmup. Increasing adapt_delta above 0.99 may help. See http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup Warning: There were 4 chains where the estimated Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information was low. See http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#bfmi-low Warning: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems fit2b &lt;- sampling(schools_mod2, data = schools_dat, control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)) For the first model and this particular data, increasing adapt_delta will not solve the problem and a reparameterization is required. mcmc_nuts_divergence(nuts_params(fit1b), log_posterior(fit1b)) mcmc_nuts_divergence(nuts_params(fit2b), log_posterior(fit2b)) 4.2.2 Energy and Bayesian fraction of missing information The mcmc_nuts_energy function creates plots similar to those presented in Betancourt (2017). While mcmcm_nuts_divergence can identify light tails and incomplete exploration of the target distribution, the mcmc_nuts_energy function can identify overly heavy tails that are also challenging for sampling. Informally, the energy diagnostic for HMC (and the related energy-based Bayesian fraction of missing information) quantifies the heaviness of the tails of the posterior distribution. The plot created by mcmc_nuts_energy shows overlaid histograms of the (centered) marginal energy distribution \\(\\pi_E\\) and the first-differenced distribution \\(\\pi_{\\Delta E}\\), mcmc_nuts_energy(np1) Warning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)): font &quot;Symbol&quot;
